Tesler was the first to successfully apply the concept of \"modularity\" or divide and conquer approach to the something as complex as a computer program. He not only discovered how to break complex functions into smaller ones, but he also understood how to re-assemble these functions, creating entirely new and novel sets of data and functions. It's stories like his that inspire others to think more deeply about the potential of data and algorithms and dreams of more powerful computer programs.`,

What is the acronym for the four main functions in a CRUD application?\nA. Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).\n\n3. What is the key benefit of using class inheritance to create objects in OOP?\nA. Class inheritance allows you to reuse existing code, which reduces the amount of time it takes to develop and maintain an application. This also allows you to use features from an existing class without having to re-implement them."`,
