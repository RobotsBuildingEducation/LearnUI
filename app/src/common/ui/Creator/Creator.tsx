What makes her story so inspiring is that she chose to focus on improving technologies in her home country, understanding the need for better robotics in India. She created a space for herself in a male-dominated field at a young age, inspiring the lives of many young girls in the process. Surya is an inspiring example of someone with a clear purpose who chose a problem she wanted to solve, and took a journey to use her skills, creativity and ambition to make real changes.`,

Their goal is to help reduce the disparate impact of the criminal justice system on people of color, survivors of domestic abuse, and other vulnerable communities.\n\nAequitas utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and analyze data regarding the demographics of the parties involved in trial proceedings (e.g., race and gender). This data is then used in tandem with Critical Race Theory to flag any instances of bias. It is hoped that this system can ultimately be used to racial disparities in the criminal justice system and ensure a more equitable system for all its participants.`,

NASA turned to computer scientist, Dr. Larry Tesler, and his team to design a user-friendly interface. After multiple iterations of new design concepts, they finally landed on a design that combined simple built-in tools and a system of transparency to display and manipulate data. Through this design, the team developed a completely novel user experience and provided an unprecedented level of control over the spacecraft‚Äôs functions. This would eventually aid in the successful development of the space shuttle and is considered to be one of the first major successes of user experience (UX) and human computer interaction (HCI) in modern user interface design.`,

          response: `\n\nSure! \n\nHuman Computer Interaction (HCI): HCI is a field of study that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers to create better user experiences. For example, if a user is presented with a list of items on an online store, the interface should be intuitive and easy to understand, allowing the user to quickly and easily find the items they need. \n\nUser Centered Design (UCD): UCD is a design process that focuses on the user and their needs. Designers must understand the user‚Äôs motivations and goals to develop solutions tailored to their requirements. This could come in the form of running A/B tests on a website to see which layout works best, or carrying out user feedback studies and surveys to validate a product before its launch.\n\nUI/UX Design: UI/UX design refers to the user interface and user experience of a product. A good UI/UX design should be aesthetically pleasing but also logical, intuitive, and easy to use. Examples include a shopping app that's optimized for touch screens and guides users through the product checkout workflow, or a website that makes navigation easy with a simple design and well thought out navigation structure.`,

The song \"All of the Lights,\" featuring Rihanna and Kid Cudi, quickly broke records, becoming West's most popular single of his career. Its impact was astonishing, charting in more than 10 countries, and climbing all the way to the number one position on the US Billboard, despite its competition from popular female singers like Katy Perry, who was at the peak of her career.\n\nThat same year, West appeared on VH1's Storytellers, a show which gives musicians the chance to explain the inspiration and implications behind their music. West spoke openly and oratorically about his vision, what he wanted to say, and how he hoped it would create a conversation with the public so they could think and discuss the issues he was addressing.\n\nWest's openness, frankness, and expression rung throughout the entire show and had an incredible impact on his fans. His words were so inspiring that social media exploded with conversations around his opinions and messages. West had given them an insight into his life and thoughts not found on any other medium or platform.\n\nThe audience walked away from the show feeling empowered, challenged, and inspired. They had been invited to go along on a journey with West as he explained his passion and vision for the future and this created a lifelong connection that continues to thrive today.\n\nKanye West is a perfect example of how expression can have a powerful impact on society and how it can be used to influence and reach people on a larger scale. Through his straight-forward and honest approach, he has managed to open up discussions and create conversations on a range of topics. West‚Äôs work continues to inspire millions today, and it is a sure testament to the power of expression.`,

After four years of a brutal Civil War, Lincoln declared:\n\"Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God‚Äôs assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men‚Äôs faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.\"\n\nBy acknowledging that both sides of the war asked God for help, Lincoln's speech acknowledges the power of divine providence. He also understood that the war was a divine trial, with both sides facing great suffering. He also made sure to point out that men are not to judge one another, and that only God knows the reason behind His purpose and His plan.`,

          response: `?\n\nSure. In an 1862 speech, Abraham Lincoln said: \n\n"We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven; we have been preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity; we have grown in numbers, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.... Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us." \n\nThis speech made it clear that Lincoln believed in the concept of divine providence, the notion that God works in human events to achieve his objectives. He was not just a believer, but he also acknowledged that blessings come from God and that the nation should rely on him for guidance and protection.`,
