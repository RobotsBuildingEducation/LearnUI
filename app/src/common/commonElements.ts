/**
 * Prompt improvements
 * ---
 * It is difficult to decide on the most effective prompt.
 * The object can improve with how it's iterated through at render time but,
 * more importantly, it may be best if we simply iterate through it.
 *
 * It is unlikely that we will select the best prompt.
 * We may approximate it. And it may improve over time.
 *
 * Since this is so intellectually difficult to optomize,
 * iteration one will depend solely on 2AM intuition.
 *
 * Current prompts:
 *
 * faq - frequently asked questions with one line answers | prompt "ask"
 * quiz - ask a set of questions with answers | prompt "quiz"
 * demonstrate - add a code example or other form of content generation | prompt "demonstrate"
 * quick - describe data as a definition. | prompt "define"
 * summarize - describe data as a summary. | prompt "summarize"
 * study guide - describe data as a review list. | prompt "guide"
 * inspire curiousity - describe data as a story. | prompt "inspire"
 * translate -  translate to spanish | prompt "en espanol"
 *
 * Current constraints:
 * When is it best to limit speech, like "provide a brief story in a few sentences" or "exactly one sentence"
 * Are there cases where more data (and therefore more load time), makes sense? Is it more engaging or
 * meaningful to a student? For now, it's not introduce constraints unless the prompt specifically asks for it, like quick mode or study
 *

 * We are storing the development of prompts in responseCollection. This makes using ChatGPT cheaper.
 * We can use chatGPT as a sandbox for results before deploying content to the client.

// add answer collector since chatGPT is mostly a valuable content generator for now

// Do not remove this code. It's a fair round of good effort that can be improved in uiSchema.tsx
