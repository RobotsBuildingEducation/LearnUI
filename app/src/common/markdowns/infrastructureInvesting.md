These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

I remember being distinctly lazy when writing this essay and relying on text found in images. This post also lead to a fruitful conversation about the value provided by Bentley Systems in particular.

## I remember being excited about Autodesk because it checked off a lot of investor items and their acquisition of a water and electronic design company had piqued my interest

TL;DR
Meaningful, sustainable, long-term employment.
The current administration and Federal Reserve are continuing to progress in setting the stage for long-term investments in the American economy.

In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments per year for 8 years in infrastructure spending.

We take a look at how Autodesk is a beneficiary of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size.

Autodesk Revenues

The Employment Problem
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Industry 4.0) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology.

Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.

A Skill Gap Problem
Ultimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others.

This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools.

In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.
Tools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired.

In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors.

Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures.
The problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.

Autodesk's recognition of its role, alongside organizations like Adobe.
The Education Solution

The reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands.

We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar "languages". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.

What I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.

AutoDesk's Role
AutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars.

There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.

- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.
- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.
- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.
- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.

The following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.

- LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.
  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a green building certification program used worldwide. Developed by the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) it includes a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings, homes, and neighborhoods which aims to help building owners and operators be environmentally responsible and use resources efficiently.

- Water maintenance system certifications with AutoDesk's end-to-end water system software, Innovyze

Innovyze is a global leader in building innovative, industry-leading software for the water industry for over 35 years; serving thousands of clients including the largest utilities, construction design firms, consultancies and refining plants around the world.

- Robotics certifications with Autodesk robotics software, Powermill

Fusion 360 with PowerMill CAM software provides expert CNC programming strategies for complex 3- and 5-axis manufacturing (the functional space where robots can move around).
