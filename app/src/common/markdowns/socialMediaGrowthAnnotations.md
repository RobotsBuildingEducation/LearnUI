So I started working with a few folks in a very minor but significant way. They're creative folks and we're going to just stay in close communication about trying to actively improve with social media.

Truthfully, a big challenge for me is that I have pretty severe ADHD, so it's pretty hard for me to be consistent in ways that some things demand, and really I just try my best to make it work. But like all things, there are tradeoffs. I digress. Let's jump into it.

There are ways to grow as a content creator and as an influencer. I believe there's a significant difference between the two. I will be publishing this in steps, and sending an alert when updates are made. I will make several changes to this post before releasing "officially". However, here's a list and you may use it however you want in the meantime.

Videos under 20k:

Usually these videos have some kind of low-effort but useful bent to them. They can be negative, combative, disagreeable, or some kind of pessimistic trait. This is kind of like doing social media on easy-mode, but I believe there may be somewhat of an upper limit to this approach when it comes to influence.

It works, and everyone can kind of relate that negative feelings just kind of have a bias for attention than positive ones, but positive ones are usually way stronger end-games. Are they bad to do? It depends on your case, but I think in terms of min-maxing and growth, you probably don't wanna depend on it because then the algorithm basically wins a round on you and you kinda wanna beat the algorithm. And sometimes these kinds of videos can bubble up.

It doesn't mean that videos that usually perform around 20-50k can't be changed into 200k+ videos. But then again it's that algorithmic bell-curve that kinda informs you about the machine you're working with.

With that noted, I've been doing a general review of my account and have noticed that I tend to just notepad a lot of content. That currently just works with me because I don't have many resources to work with.

---

How I will be taking notes:
I will probably jot down a lot of attributes in a matrix without any order. Just what I think and see and how I categorize a video. I'll add any notable context and I'll write in some data to account for lessons learned or things that may have worked.

"SEO" is short for search-engine optimization. It's an important metric that platforms like Google and Tiktok take into account when trying to "understand a video". There are many things that inform SEO like watch time, and there are other things that are more valuable than others.

For example, text on a screen is weighed more than a caption. The same is true for any social platform. Youtube greatly ranks the title. Linkedin greatly ranks professional titles.

Steps Ahead

Redo and repurpose videos. Sometimes a video tweet can be an audio-visual explanation. Sometimes a long explanation can be condensed down to 5 seconds. Do them with the intent of "getting the message right" rather than generating more content.

So primarily ask, "how can I do this a little better with the right amount of resources?" and critically re-examining performance vs. expectation.

Viral Videos (1M+ views)

Summary: as you can see, the best performing videos do not include negative energy. They include positive energy, but there is also a lot of depth behind the words. It's almost obvious in some ways - achieving positive change is difficult. achieving negative change is easy. Awesome is the best.
https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7082742762130623790?lang=en

Attributes: [video tweet, short, low-effort, high information demand, low information supply, trending topic, expert analysis, trending sound]

SEO: Elon Musk, CEO, Twitter, invested, crypto

Hook+Delivery: The reason X did Y was because Z. Z is this. This means A for the future.

Lessons learned: I remember this video being "delayed explosion", meaning that it grew to 300k on initial interest of the breaking news, and grew to 3 million after the news was confirmed. So there is more likeliness that a content can be relevant later in a timeline if the content talks about predictably relevant things. Expert opinions on complicated things can be impactful.

Attributes: [video tweet, short, low-effort, high information demand, low information supply, trending work, cultural, relatable, egalitarian]

SEO: Latino dropout, single mother, learn how to code, Bad Bunny, Juan Gabriel

Hook+Delivery: idgaf if you relate to A or B, if you wanna learn high value skill, I got you. This is how and where. This is why I think you should. I'm doing this because of these awesome reasons.

Lessons learned: Latinos are egalitarian. If you observe the comments, it's a positive kind of energy, a desire to learn and a desire to share. One comment stood out to me some time ago "help the single moms first bro". You know? We have a soft spot for certain people like the street vendors, moms, little sisters, undocumented people and kids. So I think I tapped into that part of our culture and I tapped into the part where it's like, and so what? we are still awesome and life is good. life is fun.

Attributes: [vocal-visual, gamified, effective delivery, countdown, egalitarian]

SEO: Mexican, Pro Tip, Graduating, Job, Cheap

Hook+Delivery: This is what got me <awesome things> with <less than average resources>. Here's how. Countdown + game setup.

Lessons learned: I always remembered this video and considered it possibly my best tiktok video of all time. Everything about it "just right". There are some things that can be tweaked to push for better results but I think something like this, and what's happening "under the hood" is a great demonstration. Countdowns are also a powerful thing, as it can often immerse a viewer into the subject. Even the music was game boss style.

Attributes: [music-visual, pause, color, culture, gaming, call to action, quick clips, egalitarian]

SEO: Mexican, learn how to code, donate, learn

Hook+Delivery: Hey, psst. Wait hold on. Isn't that much better? So here's the deal. Capiche?

Lessons learned: This video has really strong cultural tones and creates an immersive enough experience with it. There isn't much to say here. This could have been a lazy
video tweet video, but quick transitions and loaded imagery empowered the words.

https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7131090490077826350?lang=en

Attributes: [music-visual, trending sound, video tweet, low effort, strong claim, psycho-algorithmic outreach]

SEO: breaking into tech, easy, ready for a job, month, free, coding bootcamps, this is your sign

Hook+Delivery: Actually, difficult task is easy. In fact, it can be done this quickly and jokingly easily. Give me some time and I will show you. This is your sign

Lessons learned: This video is a good demonstration of using some mechanical things about the tiktok algorithm, like a trending video style and really strong communication to create a hook, promise or delivery. One powerful thing to note here is that creating expectations in the future can sometimes have significant consequences, which we may sometimes recognize as cliffhangers.

Attributes: [music-visual, video tweet, low effort, combative, niche trend (that I lowkey provoked lol, im such a payaso sometimes) ]

SEO: Fun fact, tech girlies, drama, 500-800%, Asian, White, Google, Black, Latina, indigenous, cute

Hook+Delivery: Fun fact bout this silly shi, real shi huh? eyeroll

Lessons learned: Eh, like stated before, some negative videos can bubble up and there isn't anything particularly notable about the video that can't be found in other videos. I suppose the potential here is that there can be a broader conversation around empowering women, which is something that unfolded in the comment section in some ways.

https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7143387443478187306?lang=en

Attributes: [music-zoom, video tweet, fun effort, egalitarian, humor, psychosexual]

SEO: Latino dropout, hmu, teach, build, strong resume, show you what, how to and review, calls, toxica, tinder, business

Hook+Delivery: yo, if you're in this inner group, hmu i'll hook you up [you implicitly know this is gonna deliver]. Heres how, what, and the results. Or you can do this
with it instead.

Lessons learned: There's a lot that's going on here and it was consequential for a period of growth. I started combining video tweets with mini-music videos with zoom filters. It adds a level of fun, immersion and vulnerability to the video. It's at this point too where I started building things outside of Tiktok, so there were stronger calls to action. People want to feel the hook up. I started tapping into the egalitarian side of the culture. These days, I just use it for fun now.

I started talking to Roxana more here. Obviously at the surface level, people see her beauty and kind of come up with their conclusions. Our conversations quickly became about social media. She had an interesting command over confidence and I was endlessly amused by how she would direct people to click a link that lead to overthrowing dictators. I consider this point where my videos started creating with more with feminine tones.

Often times I'll miss. You know, a little too strong on some tones or too light in others. But getting it right is usually a strong message of empowerment and encouragement. That goes amazingly with inspiration and curiosity. At this point now, I'll definitely overrepresent for Latinas and undocumented folks. It's just solves fundamental problems more effectively. If you can represent Latinas and undocumented folks well, you can represent all of Latin America well.

https://www.tiktok.com/@robotsbuildingeducation/video/7156747770840337707?lang=en

Attributes: [audio-visual, explanation, stock, gamified, disagreeable, combative]

SEO: Showing Mexicans How To,

Hook+Delivery: Showing You How To Make Thousands With $50 - common enemy won't tell you this but, the way to achieve mysterious generational challenge is this way.

Lessons learned: This video had me recognized by some folks with a strong institutional background regarding Hispanic wealth. But frankly, if you look at the video, the hook is pretty ridiculous and the delivery still succeeds to demonstrate.

So there's a very real relationship with the claim you're making and how well you can address it. At worst, you're viewed as a scammer. At best, you're viewed as someone rather talented. So go big. There is no option to go home.

On a related note, I'm pretty familiar with the stock market community. These people are usually pretty brash and disagreeable. Sometimes being kind is great, I've done that before and people liked to see humble winnings.

But usually, the stock market is full of opinionated amateurs who are likely overleveraged with bias in their decisions. I mean, if you're gonna disagree, you better try winning the disagreement. I don't recommend disagreeing without an unfair advantage usually.

This video likely has potential to break past 1 million views on the premise alone. So it should be foundational for future stock videos. The stock market is also gamified - so with enough show business, the videos are above-average in their level of attention grabbing and immersion.

It actually makes me wonder if some of my animated videos would perform better with me present`in a green screen just because we prefer that kind of human proximity. It's not intuitive, you would think people like to show just see an animation - but think about it, we fuck people.

Attributes: [video tweet, hypocrisy, combative, political, disagreeable]

SEO: Latinos, Bad Bunny, election time, stay home, vote, Republican, Florida, Texas, control, American election, voting Blue, two states

Hook+Delivery: In Group wants to unify this because of this trend, but when it really matters, we don't. If we look at the big picture, we undermine our potential.

Lessons learned: This was an interesting and temporary pivot I took when I started to make political content during the political midterms. So the topic was strongly
trending depending on your location and it almost felt like I was teleporting to Houston in some ways.

Negativity, in politics, is pretty effective and I would consider negative energy to be necessary in this space. Everyone loses in politics - the nature of it is for you to lose one way or the other. So it's a matter of picking what hills you want to fight for and to bring the fight to those hills.

I also engaged in light use of radical politics and propaganda by slurring racist words and stereotypes. I am a huge fan of this for oppressed people finding themselves debating in primarily white institutions. The repurposing words carry power and trauma that is difficult for opponents to handle.

Attributes: [video tweet, tragedy, combative, political, disagreeable]

SEO: Mexicans, Texas, Hispanics, largest mass shootings, August, 2019, border town, Latinos, white man, immigration, Trump, Twitter, open borders, Turn Texas Blue,
Republican, extremism

Hook+Delivery: In Group will often forget this, but here is a reminder of an truly unforgettable thing.

Lessons learned: There's a lot to say here. Many people appreciate my ability to create or understand patterns and this post was probably the most cathartic one I'll create. It's something that I felt strongly for years and would often repeat it.
I feel that Trump is genuinely responsible for the El Paso shooting and the events, like the Capitol riots, that transpired after it are no coincidence. The data is evident that instigating political violence was the primary agenda to technocratically control the conversation and direction of politics.

I'm happy that it went viral the way that it did and for me it was partially healing. I hope to repeat the message here often in the future. It is in line with my belie that radical speech ought to be used to create progress.

Attributes: [video tweet, low effort, egalitarian, generosity]

SEO: Latino dropout, nursing, Latina, grad school, Mexican, first, family business, $1,000, January, Sunday, 2023, Bad Bunny, Juan Gabriel, email, story, vision, future, apply

Lessons learned: My ADHD absolutely maxed out here. It is ridiculously difficult for me to write anything but this video is mostly a repeat of a previous successful coloring of a video with egalitarian tones.

And that's really the goal, we want that repeatable success of a video that is effective to do and maximizes impact. There's has to be ways to achieve it and reasons for failure.

It makes me think a lot though about the machine. Like how much more successful, on average, is a video that mentions Juan Gabriel than does not? Juan Gabriel has a supernatural influence over the culture. But at what point does leveraging that benefit become stale, dishonest and robotic?
