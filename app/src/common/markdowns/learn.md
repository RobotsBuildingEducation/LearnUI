This will be the actual last post.
If you want the coding crash course better organized, please visit:
https://learn-robotsbuildingeducation.web.app/

It will give you access to the 16 main lessons I want you to understand for coding your own projects. Anything other than these 16 lessons is essentially "discoverable" via Patreon.

It's fine to share it, since it's not being locked behind any kind of login process at the moment, but it can cost money because I'm using some servers. If you share it, please recommend this Patreon. Long-term, it will be for Patreon subscribers only when I implement that feature.

The code is kind of sloppy but then again this app isn't large so I didn't really care for code organization or documentation much, maybe later. https://github.com/RobotsBuildingEducation/LearnUI

This link will be included in the pinned housekeeping post. I can now begin the process of improving and condensing this content to be more consumable and less discoverable.
