# A Letter To You

This is the current email that I'm responding with. It comes from the right place and addresses many different experiences that I think is commonly shared among these emails. At times, some folks messages are a mirror reflection of what is said here. My resume and LinkedIn is attached with the email, but is kept private here on Patreon.

A Letter To You

I took some time to think about it. I believed it was best to start this engagement by writing a letter to you. I’ve received many messages that I wanted to take some time with because these kinds of conversations and connections are important to me.

So first I want to start off by saying thanks. A real mil gracias! You guys have said some wonderful, thoughtful and nice things. I think it’s a beautiful thing that you decided to reach out to me and I would be lying if I don’t feel some kind of love for you for even trying. Please feel free to connect with me privately on LinkedIn:

I know that this isn't the case for everyone, but the original message had reached out to Latino students that had dropped out of school. I’m aware that the nature of the story is that this would also target other students of color or folks that can relate to non-traditional struggles in their journeys to live a happy and stable life. You are also a very real part of this message. I think that we often forget that diversity is an environment of inclusion and although your experience may be different, your struggle or desire for safety is not. This must be true because you would otherwise not be here.

The truth is that receiving an education can be complicated for some and not for others. The reality is that it’s likely complicated for you. When you’re in an oppressed position, it’ll mostly feel like you’re kinda just used to this specific but gentle indifference of life. Most things are more out of your control and will impact you more than they ought to. We call this instability.

The chips are pretty much stacked against you too. If we’re being straight up about how complicated this is, some of you probably go through so pretty \*\*\*\*ed up things or end up in the wrong kind of places. Some of you probably go through things you shouldn’t, but can’t even identify that you shouldn’t. A very common example of this is believing that you’re not smart enough to accomplish something. An education based in love, safety and care would address those things fairly, gently and create a path for you to succeed. This is why I made the statement earlier about oppression. If this is your experience, then you are facing an injustice.

The other truth is that it’s not an absolute thing. Education is always there and its existence is meant to empower you - not employ you. What does this mean? It means if you believe that you can accomplish something then you probably can. It’s important to realize that once you draw your purpose, you will end up studying and learning what you need to study and learn rather than fitting some kind of structure where you only “do what you studied”. You can study multiple things, be multiple things, and have multiple careers.

So how do you find purpose? What I like to tell people is that they need to spend some honest time with themselves somewhere they feel safe, alone and without judgment. Take some time and think about what you want your life to be like. Really ask yourself what problem you want to solve or what problem you want to contribute to solving. It’s important not to judge yourself because you want to think big, dream big and envision a long-term challenge. There’s a sense of purpose and belief that I often practice.

You will need this resilience because it can just be complicated and the system is not built in your favor. You may have an unwelcoming commute. Your financial and living situation may be unsupportive. You may have to work part or full-time and cut into opportunities in your education. The quality of your teachers could be better. Career fairs may be low opportunity. Your family may not know how to even have conversations about your challenges. The reason you feel lesser than is because the system is built in a way to disenfranchise or discourage you. But it’s not true.

I can’t determine what your conditions are, but I know that they’re all very real and very different for everyone involved. The world today is a lot different than it was many years ago and it’s just so critical to be an advocate for yourself.

That’s it. That’s the ultimate recipe for success in education. You need inspiration, belief and resilience for your vision. You need to use fear as an advantage and opportunity to fail upward. You need to view the process as advocacy and empowerment. It doesn’t matter if you fail with that in your worldview. Failure only becomes a minor but meaningful setback in the larger experience that is your life. That’s YHLQMDLG - yo hago lo que me da la gana.

Robots Building Education (RO.B.E)

So what the hell is this man? It’s an idea that I started to develop in 2014 when I first learned how to code using the mental model that I just explained to you. I felt that education on the internet could be better and more meaningful. I also feel that policies surrounding education and equity are incorrect and would like to work on solving those problems. In some ways, I consider myself and RO.B.E as a form of political activism. But that’s neither here nor now.

Why is it that a student that has spent time succeeding in Calculus III that drops out gets treated as if they had never received an education? It seems like an injustice. Robots Building Education is a software-defined network that examines where technology should really belong in the education process. Currently there are only two fundamental beliefs:

A student should have access to a network of best-fit teachers (access).
The time you spend learning online should directly and immediately support other learning communities financially (equity)
I am currently learning about the third, and hopefully last fundamental, which addresses some subjects related to student data, identity and justice in scheduling.

Learning To Code

Take some time to think about what machines you want to work with. Picking a language doesn’t box you into a path, because most programming languages are quite similar in practice. It’s mostly what machines and why you want to work with those machines.

Want to work with people? React, UI/UX
Want to work with the brains of the internet? Python
Want to work with some robotics or graphics? C++
Want to work with IoT? Java (Android) or Swift (iOS)
Ultimately, I teach Javascript and fall under category 1 with Robots Building Education. What I’m trying to accomplish in the near-term is to develop playlists on TikTok that help people go from nothing to understanding what they generally have to learn to compete - so that they can ask less random questions and spend less time getting discouraged or overwhelmed trying to learn too much. I’m pretty good at teaching, and I try to cover many years of study in a few minutes by making it relatable. I’ll get better at it over time and the quality will always try to go upward, even if I’ve made a video on the subject before. Longterm, I hope to fulfill the ability to have access to best-fit teachers using an algorithm like Tiktok’s. These videos address many FAQ along the way that you’ll have. It gets you started on knowing what interviews will challenge you on, how to think about code so that you can build products, start businesses and find your way into stronger educational facilities.

So in a way, I try to get you to believe that you can get to the end from the beginning, because you’ll have a better idea of where to even go in the first place. My hope is that you find advanced concepts and realize that you’re totally smart enough to figure it out. I’m certain of it. But obviously you still need to learn how to code by writing it. I recommend https://www.codecademy.com/ until I figure that out too.

Why? Good question. They get your hands on a keyboard and they achieve one thing very well; they get you to feel that you can do something which is different than believing or understanding you can do something. It’s a great feeling not knowing anything about coding to writing your first lines of code and having a machine actually do something. Codecademy does a great job at that. A secret tip with Codecademy too is to post your course completions on LinkedIn. Codecademy keeps it real and likes a lot of people’s posts because they’re in the business of creating professionals.

So Robots Building Education + Codecademy is a strong and engaging starter kit while being very low-pressure and low-stakes. Once you learn how to code and create things or projects - you really have to ask yourself how you’re going to compete. It also changes things. How does your social environment change knowing that you have different opportunities or outcomes? What choices are you seeking to make because of that?

Regardless of being self-taught, coding bootcamp, community college, university or ivy league you have to:

Network
Have some form of education
Find experience (school, career fairs, freelance, consulting)
Have projects
Study for technical interviews
So it’s not an easy road. You gotta have some resilience to achieve each step. The field is competitive but there is still a massive demand for these skills in general. This was true when I was first learning how to code and it's true today. So don’t count yourself out just because some kid goes to a fancy school or has taken a bunch of math courses. There’s a bigger picture here and you probably want to find yourself in it.

Most of it you can figure out except maybe the networking part. That part is hard for a lot of people. It’s actually easy. You go to events, connect on slacks, discords, linkedIns, Tiktoks. It’s just putting yourself out there and not being too hard on yourself such that you invalidate yourself from opportunities. I’ve included some communities at the bottom designed for this kinda stuff. I’m also part of your network too! See how easy that was :)

Resume

Common Resume Improvements / Pre-audit checklist

Note: This resume may also apply to other technical roles like UI/UX work or product management. The competitive structure is the same with many tech jobs with regards to experience and demonstrations.

One thing that I believe in Robots Building Education is that communication skill is the most valuable skill. So our subscription redirections go directly to support writing, speaking and creative skills.

Before doing a full resume review, it saves some time to offer this advice. This also serves a way to model the real-world, where people will examine your resume for about 6-10 seconds. So if I can detect that your resume can have improvements, then this audit is designed for that. It's essentially "speaking the language" of the first person responsible for hiring, that often has done this too many times to count. Other than that, it's a good way to show what a relatively decent candidate looks like. Use this as a competitive guideline.

The story behind this process is that I was a pretty strong candidate out of college but was not getting calls back. This was a communication problem. So I really thought about how to best sell myself within 6 seconds. The attached resume was something I created out of college that worked.

Some of it was visual, but the principle behind it all was this idea of communicating that I’m a strong candidate. That’s really the goal of a resume. So I achieved that, and started to get calls from places like Tesla and random good shit like that.

The big lesson learned here is that communication is powerful. It's powerful when creating your email, in your interview, in your relationships, on social media, and so on. Many people can relate to the nature of having good ideas, but how do you go from idea to creation? A big part of it is that communication skill. It's something I preach about I guess. And it's absolute facts, because the only reason I'm able to even send this out to hundreds of people in an authentic way is because I care about my writing or communication over the years. So:

1 page
No summaries. The information included in your summary can likely be reworked into your experience or projects.
Education first. Just get it over with. It’s mostly an after thought so just include name of place, certification date, what you studied. GPA is pointless, even if you’re a perfect 5.0 person. (Still, try to get good grades). Don’t add relevant coursework. It’s not relevant. Your degree or study says enough. If you have an “unrelated” education like Mechanical Engineering or an English bachelors, who cares. It’s a fucking education and you have a brain that is capable of learning more than one fucking thing
Technical skills second, spoken languages included.
Be honest about your technical skills. If you include it in your resume, expect to talk at length or freely about it. So if you don’t feel comfortable with there, it’s better to remove it. The reason being is, you want your resume to have a tight control and for something to inspire confidence. Honesty leads to confidence and confidence leads to performance. I would not trade that off for something that a reviewer will only glance at or randomly talk about.
Talk about impact of implementations in work history, or communicate how your experience and role can predict good impact. Again, be honest. Resist using fluff. Fluff makes you sound weaker and less concise if anything. It’s easily detected and ignored. So implementations > management > team player experience generally. Also talk about business here. So if you’re applying to some cloud company, try to have experience with things like APIs or other system level things if possible. In general be familiar with how the internet basically works and where you fit into it.
Same goes for projects. Try to develop sound business projects. Don’t use this space as fluff. One well-defined, strategically built project is better than a bunch of toy projects that say “I can code”. Often I recommend building something simple like a social media application using tools like Twitter or other popular app APIs. Then build a personal project. Be less strict here and more curious. Have fun and enjoy it. Reason being is you want that energy.
Use bullet points
In a nutshell, your resume should look like this:

Projects

Personal Project. Ideally larger in scope. Creative. Systems thinking. Open ended. - Used out-of-box solutions like create-react-app and firebase to develop products faster. - Developed a product out of some shit I enjoy, like basketball or education or whatever. It’s really up to you. - Have fun. Do so, so that when you/if you talk about it, the enjoyment radiates :)
Business project. Ideally controlled level of scope. Practical. Project thinking. Close-ended.
E.g: Built an application leveraging Twitter, Shopify and Stripe APIs to create a social commerce application.
Developed products using testing-first approach using jest for unit tested functions and Cypress for UI automation
Implemented code quality rules with ESLint and Prettier
Configured a custom and lightweight webpack setup
Implemented error detection with Sentry
Utilized Github Actions to create light a CI/CD pipeline
The list goes on. These projects can have infinite growth for all your concerned with, so don’t get too crazy like I listed here. I’m just showing you how to approach it.

Conclusion

You have a lot of work cut in front of you and significant decisions that you need to make. It won’t be easy. I recommend not being too hard on yourself when the going gets rough. And frankly, it’s not so bad even when the going gets really rough. Adding more love to your life and well-being will always set your along the right way to appreciate the outcomes of your life :). So err on the side of honesty, fail faster, try your best and feel free to stay in touch. Believe in yourself! Invest in yourself! Echale ganas! I have to try my best too!

Peace.

Robots Building Education (RO.B.E): https://www.patreon.com/RobotsBuildingEducation

An early version of an idea that will be built on Roblox - a network where your subscription is

redistributed to other students based on engagement and digital learning events.

This is the best way to support my ideas behind the channel since it actualizes the original concept.

Techqueria https://techqueria.org/

These folks are way more official than I am. They have a slack channel to stay in touch and some other structural things meant to support your career and development as a Latino professional.

UI/UX Learning: https://www.nngroup.com/training/

Don Norman is one of the leaders in design applications and is often taught in academic levels of human-computer interaction and computer science. There are certifications available, but it is encouraged to pair that in a familiar field of study like computer science, architecture or psychology.

Society of Hispanic Engineers: https://shpe.org/

These folks are official & chapter based in plenty of schools. They try to support your family and journey.

I come across them in plenty of resumes and have seen them in passing while creating content.

100devs: https://leonnoel.com/100devs/

Compa here seems to be running something well established on the internet and have seen them mentioned plenty of times during my content creation journey. It appears to be free, structured, and a network for employment.

Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/

I often recommend this place to learn to code. The idea being that you achieve the understanding that you are capable of coding more than anything. It's a great service to get familiar with the basics of coding.

It's one of the few subscriptions that I recommend.

Fireship https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship

A nice Youtube channel that I like :)
