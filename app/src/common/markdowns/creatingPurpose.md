# A Letter To You

This is the current email that I'm responding with. It comes from the right place and addresses many different experiences that I think is commonly shared among these emails. At times, some folks messages are a mirror reflection of what is said here.

My resume and LinkedIn is attached with the email, but is kept private here on Patreon.

A Letter To You

I took some time to think about it. I believed it was best to start this engagement by writing a letter to you. I’ve received many messages that I wanted to take some time with because these kinds of conversations and connections are important to me.

So first I want to start off by saying thanks. A real mil gracias! You guys have said some wonderful, thoughtful and nice things. I think it’s a beautiful thing that you decided to reach out to me and I would be lying if I don’t feel some kind of love for you for even trying.

Please feel free to connect with me privately on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheilfer

I know that this isn't the case for everyone, but the original message had reached out to Latino students that had dropped out of school. I’m aware that the nature of the story is that this would also target other students of color or folks that can relate to non-traditional struggles in their journeys to live a happy and stable life. You are also a very real part of this message.

I think that we often forget that diversity is an environment of inclusion and although your experience may be different, your struggle or desire for safety is not. This must be true because you would otherwise not be here.

The truth is that receiving an education can be complicated for some and not for others. The reality is that it’s likely complicated for you. When you’re in an oppressed position, it’ll mostly feel like you’re kinda just used to this specific but gentle indifference of life.

Most things are more out of your control and will impact you more than they ought to. We call this instability.

The chips are pretty much stacked against you too. If we’re being straight up about how complicated this is, some of you probably go through so pretty \*\*\*\*ed up things or end up in the wrong kind of places.

Some of you probably go through things you shouldn’t, but can’t even identify that you shouldn’t. A very common example of this is believing that you’re not smart enough to accomplish something.

An education based in love, safety and care would address those things fairly, gently and create a path for you to succeed. This is why I made the statement earlier about oppression. If this is your experience, then you are facing an injustice.

The other truth is that it’s not an absolute thing. Education is always there and its existence is meant to empower you - not employ you. What does this mean? It means if you believe that you can accomplish something then you probably can.

It’s important to realize that once you draw your purpose, you will end up studying and learning what you need to study and learn rather than fitting some kind of structure where you only “do what you studied”. You can study multiple things, be multiple things, and have multiple careers.

So how do you find purpose? What I like to tell people is that they need to spend some honest time with themselves somewhere they feel safe, alone and without judgment. Take some time and think about what you want your life to be like.

Really ask yourself what problem you want to solve or what problem you want to contribute to solving. It’s important not to judge yourself because you want to think big, dream big and envision a long-term challenge. There’s a sense of purpose and belief that I often practice.

You will need this resilience because it can just be complicated and the system is not built in your favor.

You may have an unwelcoming commute. Your financial and living situation may be unsupportive. You may have to work part or full-time and cut into opportunities in your education. The quality of your teachers could be better. Career fairs may be low opportunity.

Your family may not know how to even have conversations about your challenges. The reason you feel lesser than is because the system is built in a way to disenfranchise or discourage you. But it’s not true.

I can’t determine what your conditions are, but I know that they’re all very real and very different for everyone involved. The world today is a lot different than it was many years ago and it’s just so critical to be an advocate for yourself.

That’s it. That’s the ultimate recipe for success in education. You need inspiration, belief and resilience for your vision. You need to use fear as an advantage and opportunity to fail upward. You need to view the process as advocacy and empowerment.

It doesn’t matter if you fail with that in your worldview. Failure only becomes a minor but meaningful setback in the larger experience that is your life. That’s YHLQMDLG - yo hago lo que me da la gana.

Robots Building Education (RO.B.E)

So what the hell is this man? It’s an idea that I started to develop in 2014 when I first learned how to code using the mental model that I just explained to you. I felt that education on the internet could be better and more meaningful.

I also feel that policies surrounding education and equity are incorrect and would like to work on solving those problems. In some ways, I consider myself and RO.B.E as a form of political activism. But that’s neither here nor now.

Why is it that a student that has spent time succeeding in Calculus III that drops out gets treated as if they had never received an education? It seems like an injustice. Robots Building Education is a software-defined network that examines where technology should really belong in the education process.

Currently there are only two fundamental beliefs:

A student should have access to a network of best-fit teachers (access).
The time you spend learning online should directly and immediately support other learning communities financially (equity)
I am currently learning about the third, and hopefully last fundamental, which addresses some subjects related to student data, identity and justice in scheduling.

Learning To Code

Take some time to think about what machines you want to work with. Picking a language doesn’t box you into a path, because most programming languages are quite similar in practice. It’s mostly what machines and why you want to work with those machines.

Want to work with people? React, UI/UX
Want to work with the brains of the internet? Python
Want to work with some robotics or graphics? C++
Want to work with IoT? Java (Android) or Swift (iOS)

Ultimately, I teach Javascript and fall under category 1 with Robots Building Education. What I’m trying to accomplish in the near-term is to develop playlists on TikTok that help people go from nothing to understanding what they generally have to learn to compete - so that they can ask less random questions and spend less time getting discouraged or overwhelmed trying to learn too much.

I’m pretty good at teaching, and I try to cover many years of study in a few minutes by making it relatable.

I’ll get better at it over time and the quality will always try to go upward, even if I’ve made a video on the subject before. Longterm, I hope to fulfill the ability to have access to best-fit teachers using an algorithm like Tiktok’s.

These videos address many FAQ along the way that you’ll have. It gets you started on knowing what interviews will challenge you on, how to think about code so that you can build products, start businesses and find your way into stronger educational facilities.
