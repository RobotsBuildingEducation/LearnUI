From ms. roxana:

Abraham Lincoln is one of the most iconic figures in history thanks to his incredible leadership and commitment to the principles of freedom and democracy. Throughout his life and career, Lincoln was heavily influenced by his faith in divine providence and he often expressed this in his rhetoric and public statements.

He believed that, while humans had agency to control their own destinies, ultimate success and ultimate justice were not possible without the guidance and intervention of a higher power. As president, Lincoln expressed his views on divine providence through his actions.

In his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation of September 1862, he declared that “[d]espite of the Executive will, on the part of the government of the United States, slavery will be abolished.”

This was in contrast to the belief held by some that humans alone were the agents of change and were fully responsible for their own success or failure.

Through this proclamation, Lincoln expressed his belief that divine intervention was needed for slavery’s end, and for lasting peace in the United States. Throughout the Civil War, Lincoln often argued that divine providence was on the side of the Union, and that it worked in mysterious ways.

He wrote in 1864 that “[t]oo much confidence can not be placed in the ultimate justice of the people” but noted that his “firm reliance upon the Almighty God who has never yet forsaken” would be his strength in the difficult times.

Similarly, in his second inaugural address, he expressed his confidence in God’s ultimate victory for freedom and justice over the forces of treason and disunion.

Throughout his presidency, Lincoln continued to turn to divine providence for strength and comfort. He wrote that he was “constantly build[ing] upon the sure foundations of divine Providence,” and that he was “trusting in His gracious goodness and boundless mercy” during the turbulent times in which he endured as president.

For Lincoln, divine providence was an ultimate source of reassurance and hope, one which he deeply believed in and held firm to until his death.

Abraham Lincoln’s faith in divine providence is an enduring legacy of his leadership and his commitment to justice and freedom.

His faith was a pillar of strength and courage that carried him through the most trying periods of his presidency, and it stands as an example of the power of faith even in the chaos and uncertainty of life. For those who struggle in their own lives, Lincoln’s deep faith in divine providence can continue to be a source of strength, hope, and comfort.

Abraham Lincoln was a great leader who believed in the concept of divine providence. He saw God's hand in the events of his day, and he believed that the United States had a special purpose in history.

In his Gettysburg Address, Lincoln declared that the nation had been “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” and that the Union soldiers were fighting for a just cause.

Later, in his Second Inaugural Address, Lincoln articulated a view of God's role in history and the nation's destiny: “The Almighty has his own purposes….Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.

Lincoln acknowledged that the Civil War was a great tragedy, but he ultimately saw it as part of God's larger plan.

In his Second Inaugural Address, he suggested that the war was necessary for the nation to come to true freedom and equality: “Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.

Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said 'the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’”

Here, Lincoln suggests that the Civil War was necessary to allow the oppressed to receive justice, and he turns to God to make sure that justice is served. Abraham Lincoln's strong belief in divine providence played an important role in his thoughts on the Civil War.

He believed that God had a plan for the nation and that the conflict was a key part of that plan. Through his words, he showed his recognition of God's role in the history of the nation and the justice that should follow.

Lincoln's willingness to recognize and accept divine providence offered hope and guidance during one of the darkest times in American history.

From RO.B.E
Hear ye Hear ye, I'm slamming caffeine late at night and I've really been thinking about the awesomeness that was the history of Abraham Lincoln.

There is a philosophy section here. I gotta add Abraham Lincoln. I tell you it's great stuff.

I mean, it's totally fascinating. Really crazy guy that guy. I'm not gonna go too instagram here on Patreon but, god damn it's pretty fucking crazy how crazy that entire part of history was.

It got me thinking about the importance of what problems to be steadfast with. Lincoln seemed to believe in providence, or divine protection, care and guidance.

He was intellectually purposeful, angry, depressed guy that commanded with viral inducing speech and orations.

It was an incredible combination of things. He was so committed to the application of not extending slavery. I can see why many in the country believe in these propagandas regarding party names and states rights.

There are grains of truth to what is argued. Lincoln was a politician and statesman rather than a hero. He was a warhawk if the job demanded it.

But the truth is that preventing the extension of slavery as a function of the federal government would inevitably vanquish it. Their fear was true, it would have been abolished and Lincoln was dedicated to the success of abolition.

And to me, that really feels like the birth of this country, after the civil war, its reconstruction, the trials that were faced onward regarding civil liberties, and the courts and the democracy that surrounded it.

So ultimately I think we're in the right place. History is always being created and its omnipresent, and we live in the realm where Lincoln was successful in his determinations and goals. But I don't believe anyone is capable of understanding how challenging the goal of "creating all men equally" is.

We can produce inequality as much as we do equality. I don't think anyone can deny that we still have work to do, and it isn't productive to ask silly questions like "what laws strictly prohibit actions by people of color?"

Back then, when holding the powers to amend the constitution so meaningfully, they debated strongly about slavery, its validity, and its retirement.

Today, we might be shocked by small clauses like, "[enslavement is not legal] except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted", but some argue that this text is meant to deny pedantic definitions.

Are students who face detention considered slaves? What about undocumented migrants living in a small shelter aside a farm or factory?

But these kinds are of things are attempts of truth. We can argue that there were and are always clever constructions of law, order and even psychological control with policing during the Jim Crow era or in the current drug war era.

I think if Lincoln were alive today, he would understand that the these things are firmly connected and may experience that similar anger, depression and belief in providence to so.

I will make this post public for now. I recommend to take a weekend morning sometime to just read about or into Lincoln and the history there.
