Hear ye Hear ye, I'm slamming caffeine late at night and I've really been thinking about the awesomeness that was the history of Abraham Lincoln.

There is a philosophy section here. I gotta add Abraham Lincoln. I tell you it's great stuff. I mean, it's totally fascinating. Really crazy guy that guy. I'm not gonna go too instagram here on Patreon but, god damn it's pretty fucking crazy how crazy that entire part of history was.

It got me thinking about the importance of what problems to be steadfast with. Lincoln seemed to believe in providence, or divine protection, care and guidance. He was intellectually purposeful, angry, depressed guy that commanded with viral inducing speech and orations.

It was an incredible combination of things. He was so committed to the application of not extending slavery. I can see why many in the country believe in these propagandas regarding party names and states rights. There are grains of truth to what is argued. Lincoln was a politician and statesman rather than a hero. He was a warhawk if the job demanded it.

But the truth is that preventing the extension of slavery as a function of the federal government would inevitably vanquish it. Their fear was true, it would have been abolished and Lincoln was dedicated to the success of abolition.

And to me, that really feels like the birth of this country, after the civil war, its reconstruction, the trials that were faced onward regarding civil liberties, and the courts and the democracy that surrounded it.

So ultimately I think we're in the right place. History is always being created and its omnipresent, and we live in the realm where Lincoln was successful in his determinations and goals. But I don't believe anyone is capable of understanding how challenging the goal of "creating all men equally" is. We can produce inequality as much as we do equality. I don't think anyone can deny that we still have work to do, and it isn't productive to ask silly questions like "what laws strictly prohibit actions by people of color?"

Back then, when holding the powers to amend the constitution so meaningfully, they debated strongly about slavery, its validity, and its retirement. Today, we might be shocked by small clauses like, "[enslavement is not legal] except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted", but some argue that this text is meant to deny pedantic definitions. Are students who face detention considered slaves? What about undocumented migrants living in a small shelter aside a farm or factory?

But these kinds are of things are attempts of truth. We can argue that there were and are always clever constructions of law, order and even psychological control with policing during the Jim Crow era or in the current drug war era. I think if Lincoln were alive today, he would understand that the these things are firmly connected and may experience that similar anger, depression and belief in providence to so.

I will make this post public for now. I recommend to take a weekend morning sometime to just read about or into Lincoln and the history there.
