This is an initial post that will grow, but I want to add this to the "curriculum" because I want to add content here that is mindful of folks without documents and possible language barrier issues.
It's just basic economics. Many undocumented immigrants will eventually plug into some kind of network that leads them into labor positions. That just the nature of the beast. But that doesn't mean that it always has to be like that. There is no rule stopping an undocumented immigrant from learning the ins and outs of tech business and tech entrepreneurialism. There is no rule stopping an undocumented person from working from home and delivering software priced at $2,000 - $10,000++

What stops an undocumented person from consulting business with things Shopify or Bitcoin for the growing creator market and whatever other business services flourish after 2020? Honestly this begins a completely different conversation on different ways to play the t ech industry and we ought to remember how unimaginably large it is. People can create their own slice of the pie in a number of ways in this cloud-first style era.

What I'm talking about here is specialization. I'm sure in the future, there's going to be a supply and demand for services related to Tesla, Zoom, Shopify, Bitcoin, Slack, or these days, ChatGPT. It's not too far from being an expert in data storage techniques or being an excellent "full-stack" developer. People pay for what people know rather than what can be done. It's up to people like us in our position and privileges to maybe help people through education and awareness.

So that's a rough introduction to why I'm including this and the direction I'd liekt o take it long-term.
