These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.

I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.

I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult.

It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.

Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others.

I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

I did such a bad job with this essay that I can't post it because it's an injustice.

we'll start version 0.1 with just that statement. If you want to get ahead of me on this update, take some time to understand this company's philosophy on the cloud:
