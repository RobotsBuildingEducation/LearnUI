## Driving The Price Under $1

This should be my last post before I go back and start to unify more things. The next significant update other than that is maybe creating a different interface so I can organize the information here with collections instead of a sequential list.

Once the web app is available, the price of this Patreon should decline a fair amount for a period of time. People that buy into the Patreon will have access to another version of it, meaning that monthly subscriptions are not necessary.

This may not always exists though. Eventually, some things will probably require "logging in with Patreon" or things like that. I'm kind of excited just to have content honestly, content is such a huge gatekeeping element to education technology. Being able ti pair it up with a content generator like Chat GPT is fantastic too.

## Tech Recession Stocks

Well if you happen to be following me on social media, I'm chasing this lady in the most absurd manner, but we both agreed that it would be productive of me to do it a certain way. So I'm buying a house, but I'm gonna do it in my unconventional way. I'm gonna go into it right now actually because it's gonna take time for me to improve the quality of this Patreon, so I might as well lay it out.

Like, yeah the real reason I'm buying a house is because I'm chasing a woman, but like, what else is a house good for? I can make the argument that it's a great use of leverage, because you get to multiply a down payment and invest your rent money into a usable, appreciating property located in blue-chip geopolitical land. But then again, I can argue that leverage sucks. debt sucks. Profit is awesome.

Making money is awesome. Yeah, there are financial tools at people's disposal, but at the end of the day, when push comes to shove, creating money is better than using money.

And my temperament makes me feel strong about how I use or purpose money. I couldn't really care for having a home, personally, because I really just need a desk, internet, running water and something reasonable to sleep on. But if there's a lady in the equation then a house is just more meaningful. Why the hell would I want my partner living in an apartment?

And therein lies the philosophical economics of this situation. She's not even my girlfriend. But she can be. So I might as well use some economic fuel into housing and real estate.

Okay. So yeah that's kind of ridiculous but whatever. There are these rules that help people buy their first home. I'm leveraging those rules because why not? It makes things fun and interesting. It's not really that important to over-engineer or min-max your first property. I asked Reddit about it, and they said I should leave my stocks alone and separate the concerns.

But it's like, if the $10,000 amount is already pre-defined, does it really matter where the money is? These index funds investors, I swear, they're truly dinosaurs. They just can't seem to think beyond the constraints initially presented to them at times. It's the most bizarre thing. I hate stock market people.

Anyway, so that's the game plan, and I'm going to be pouring money into some high speed tech stocks. The money can go up, down, it doesn't matter. All that matters in the IRA account is putting some fixed amount of money monthly until that number says $10,000.

I will continue to invest in it forever though. Obviously over time, stocks may change. but hopefully not by much. If anything, I hope to invest in less stocks over time. My ideal situation right now would be something like Meta, Block, Pinterest and Patreon.

Simple. Well understood, productive, profit generating, innovative stocks. If you've read my other stock content, you would know the things I weigh into when I think about these companies.

And that's where I came up with my final conclusion. It's really painstaking to think about whether or not I should do something, or whether or not I should apply a constraint to an idea, belief, understanding or investment.

In the end, I decided that companies should be reasonably & predictably profitable, identifiably American, and generally leans more on Warren Buffet's bias with securities. The creator economy is here and I'm going to invest in its brightest pipelines and platforms.

In the meantime, I'll hold a some stocks and invest in a small basket of innovative companies just to get my itch scratched, but I will trade it all in for something like Patreon when available.

Ultimately, after years of decisions and solving for time-spent-looking-at-stocks, my final thought process sorted was Buffet's explanation of his investment in Coca Cola. The brand is iconic and its unit economics is dead simple to understand.

It's a pretty amazing example of mastery of micro and macro economic parts of business. I think the same could be said about creator economies. Well, if I had a piece of advice to give you, I would spend an order of magnitude more amount of time understanding the thought process and execution of Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.

With all that being said, if you decide to use my portfolio as research inspiration, it is meant to be component-like. So a more conservative approach to something like Meta would be Apple. A more conservative approach to something like Block would be Bank of America or Visa.

A more conservative approach to Pinterest would be Google. You get the point.

# Tech Recession Thinking

---

I’m not gonna lie. I find writing about this subject to be hilariously difficult. Learning about picking stocks and focus investing was one of the most, if not the most, difficult things I have ever learned, let alone talk about. It was fucking hard. It still is.

In this case, I’m going to allow myself to ramble in various directions in the honest attempt to connect different models required to do something like this. Selecting business investments is a lot like being a designer.

There is something wrong with talking about it, because like design and art, much of it can be left to opinion. Something that may work in one period of time may not work in the next. Things change because it’s driven by human behavior.

That is really difficult to approximate. At times, it even feels like a fool’s errand and there are many investors that will loudly proclaim that it is. They are not unreasonable for believing so. It is just a position. Many amateurs fail to understand why reasonable things seemingly don’t matter in the market. A common example of this is an investor getting excited over some new company update that apparently makes them more competitive, only for it to have a minor or nonexistent impact in the market.

So get used to thinking in positions.

Have an idea, test it, defend it and expand your knowledge. The thing about stock investing is that it’s ultimately down to what you believe is reasonable. It’s an identity problem of sorts. It’s how you view the world and how you model your understanding of how it works. You may have heard about this to an extent before, as people being risk-adverse or risk-friendly. That’s part of it.

It all boils down to what you believe is reasonable in relation to the state of the market. So I can tell you to invest in the next big thing, and you may reject it on some premise, and I may not, or vice versa.

There’s no controlling that. One way or another, if you remain humble in your thoughts, it will take you a long way.

One of the golden rules in this game is to invest in what you know. It gives you an advantage when it comes to addressing bias in the quality of your thoughts. One of my biggest challenges here was asking myself

“What do I really know and what do I think I know? Is this true or do I want it to be true?”. I still ask myself this often. It’s one of the great lessons I’ve learned from doing this and I’m grateful for that.
