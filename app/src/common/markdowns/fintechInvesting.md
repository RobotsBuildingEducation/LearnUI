These are essays that I wrote when I first started my career as a content creator. I started as a writer on Reddit in May 2020-2021. I had recently started investing in the stock market after many years of market-watching on the sidelines while I went to school and learn computer science.
I think a lot of these early actions are important even if they're outdated. There should be some consistent truth to what I'm saying. The difference should be depth. My introduction to the stock market was through products like Bitcoin, AMD, Paypal, Shopify, Tesla, Facebook and the like from 2016 onward. Not much has changed.
I think it's a great position to be in as a tech investor. I have the benefits of growing up with technology and in some ways I can kind of see that the internet was a child when I was a child and an adult when I was an adult. It's great to have be on the horizon of seeing these companies perform in the market for that famous "10 year" amount and it's great being a customer of many of these organizations for up to 20 years.
Eventually, these essays will be improved upon - things change. You may see some of the changes already in other Patreon posts. They serve as domains of business or product knowledge. It should help you think about technology more too. Some essays are better than others. I was writing for an audience that I largely did not care about and was constrained by that relationship. So some sections are more thoughtful than others to serve the relevancy matrix of the forum I was participating in.

The Fundamental Constraint
MOD DISCLAIMER: This post discusses B\*tcoin in an academic sense. I absolutely do not intend for this post to be speculative about the asset by any means and it is solely within the context of Square's strategy, business risk, and environment. This post is about under-banking, regulatory constraints, and financial services.

The Underbanking Map
This one is not going to be easy to understand, so get your coffee ready and get comfortable. It’s going to be difficult to digest the technology behind Square because it asks you to believe the premise that banking is going to change in unforeseeable ways in the near future. I currently work in the Banking-as-a-Service sector as an engineer, so I have some insight that I could offer.
A fair amount of people may not know this, but organizations like Stripe, Square, PayPal, and other fintech infrastructures are just network layers over existing banks. For example, Stripe partners with Evolve Bank while Square partners with Sutton Bank. This is a win-win scenario, for now, where banks get to see the benefits of technology distribution powers, while tech companies gain a shortcut to regulatory requirements.
It may help to accept this by understanding the idea that drives the financial technology sector. In order to distribute financial services to people, regardless of net worth, trustworthiness and accountability must be established. These are regulatory frameworks developed by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), Anti Money Laundering (AML) or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) that are also challenged by such technologies like B\*tcoin, where validation is arbitrary and based on advanced fingerprinted privacy. This trustworthiness is also the reason why you’re able to instantly invest in your RH account - you are a trusted user and there is no reason to believe that you are somebody else.

The KYC Bottleneck
Just take Charlie Munger's advice to inverse. If these new currencies are bad because they cannot detect crime, then it means that you belong to a system that assumes you are untrustworthy first. These relationships are constantly monitored in things like credit score, loans, and other means of securing wealth.

The KYC Solution
It is, then, no secret as to why Square invested in B\*tcoin. There are other reasons, even cultural, as to why they did, but the basic root behind the decision is that it allows research into new verification methods that makes shipping financial services even more frictionless. It is a potential vector for changing the rules of the game and leveling the playing field, so to speak. Being a software-first bank allows you to distribute at a much more rapid pace than a traditional large bank. To be totally frank, the American banking industry has quite a brutal history. Enter Jay-Z.

In short, The fuel of fintech is the underbanked. The combustion engine that burns it is cybersecurity and AI to validate that a user is trustworthy each time they commit a transaction. This is known as the KYC Problem and how each organization approaches the regulatory requirement to verify that a user is not committing fraud will determine the outcome of who dominates the fintech sector. This is also why you see customer-service as a pervasive problem.

The Underbanked
Jack Dorsey is an interesting character, who views on technology can be highlighted

The playbook
Interestingly enough, Twitter is used in such a manner. The Tweet system these days gets shared across all social media platforms due to its simple design and even appears interactively during sporting events or billboards.
In my view, Jack Dorsey sees the current period of time as a turning point in internet communications and the underbanked. It is clear as day in its marketing strategy, where Square seller services is marketed strongly toward immigrants and minority America. while Cash App is strongly marketed toward young, first-time banking customers. No really, go ahead and look at two things:

- Cash App’s Twitter and advertising strategy

Urban strategy
Youth strategy

- The geographic results on Google Trends when searching “Cash App vs. Venmo”. Southern USA generally sees less banking due to increased poverty.

Underbanking strategy
It is clear as day and the reason is due to the nature of the demographics of underbanked users. You see, access to banking is not much different than access to the internet or access to clean water. That is, the closer you are to poverty, the closer you are to lacking access to basic resources. What is interesting about Square’s youth and culture strategy is that it builds a life-long trust with the org. You’ve heard it before, “why doesn’t school teach us important thing like taxes or investing?”. Square is attacking that pulse in its design. It offers:
The ability to start a business
The ability to invest and educate in basic stocks
The ability to invest and educate in B\*tcoin
The ability to save on basic purchases
The ability to file taxes (not yet, but the company acquired the means to)

Reality
What this inevitably means is that we probably won’t even see Square operating at “full-force” until at least 2030 and beyond, as these early aged customers grow with Square and embed more of their financials.
Speculation
This is what I expect after examining regulatory environments, product quality, and competitive outlooks:
Square will either acquire Sutton Bank or reduce its dependency on Sutton Bank’s regulatory offerings.
Square will become a bank to avoid direct competition with Big Tech, while competing aggressively against Big Banking by offering the ability to ship financial services.
The way they will achieve this is by developing a stronger form of cybersecurity and AI that will allow a smoother verification process.
Square will develop an internet railway, where exchanging currency will be accessible in different mediums like video-games or streams that may compete with organizations like Visa or MasterCard.
Square will compete with Banking-as-a-service and checkout offerings like Stripe, Plaid, and Shopify.
Square will foray into equal housing.
Square will improved loan systems.
Square will enter taboo markets like cannabis.
