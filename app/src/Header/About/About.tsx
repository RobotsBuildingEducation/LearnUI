          <h2>Robots Building Education</h2>
          <p>
            Robots Building Education is a system that believes your digital
            learning should create immediate impact for another student or
            teacher. It uses a "proof of work" to share how often RO.B.E is used
            collectively. Proof of work creates a protocol called <b>Impact</b>,
            which distributes subscription or user deposits to a student or
            teacher in a school underserved by its regulators. The current
            version of this generates and distributes $1,000 scholarships.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to create a powerful first hour of learning in order to
            embolden your ambitions by showing you how quickly you can
            accomplish a challenging goal with the right help.
          </p>
          <h2>Testimonials</h2>
          <p>
            I have not collected testimonials. I'm sure the right ones will come
            in due time. Here are some relationships I'm proud to have created
            organically through media. Khan Academy was what inspired me many
            years ago, so I'm happy to be here how I am today. You might notice
            that energy here!

          <h2>Content</h2>
          <p>
            You're going to find a collection of various materials here. The
            idea is to illustrate a story of information that is valuable to you
            and likely harder to achieve if you come from a disadvantaged
            background. Many people have used it to get encouraged to complete a
            college education or to unlearn things that set one back.
